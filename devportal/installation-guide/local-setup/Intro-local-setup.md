The VeeCode DevPortal can run in different environments. For testing, experimentation, and local development, we provide a simplified installation method using **VKDR (VeeCode Kubernetes Development Runtime)**.

VKDR is a command-line tool that automatically provisions a **lightweight Kubernetes cluster** and sets up the essential dependencies required for the DevPortal to run.

Normally, these components would require manual installation, network adjustments, and complex integrations — but VKDR abstracts this complexity and delivers a ready-to-use environment within minutes.

## Goal of this section

In this section, you will learn how to:
1. **[Installing VKDR](1-vkdr-install.md) → Set up the VeeCode Kubernetes Development Runtime (VKDR) on your machine.
2. **[Configuring the Infrastructure](2-infra.md) → Provision a lightweight local Kubernetes cluster with the required dependencies.
3. **[Setting up the GitHub Token](3-github.md) → Generate and configure a GitHub token to enable repository access and integrations.
4. **[Installing the DevPortal](install-devportal.md) → Deploy and run the DevPortal locally, then access its interface.
5. **Access and Testing:** How to access and verify the local operation of DevPortal, ensuring everything is set up correctly (TODO).

This is the fastest way to get hands-on with the VeeCode DevPortal in practice.
