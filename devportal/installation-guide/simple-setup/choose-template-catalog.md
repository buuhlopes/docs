A **Template Catalog** is a special repository that contains templates for users to create new catalog elements using VeeCode DevPortal. A properly configured DevPortal will use this to provide a user-friendly interface where users will be able to (for example):

- Create new applications (without touching any infrastructure)
- Provision cloud resources (e.g., compute, storage, networks, etc.)
- Create new API catalogs and API products

...and so on.

We recommend that you start by forking (or just copying) our [public base catalog](https://github.com/veecode-platform/public-catalog) into the organization/group you have chosen.

:::note
You may simply point directly to the public base catalog repository if you don't plan to make any changes to it, but forking/copying is recommended for better security and control (you should work with your own template catalog).
