Use this checklist to ensure you're ready to install the DevPortal.

- Kubernetes cluster available and reachable (kubeconfig set)
- `kubectl` and `helm` installed locally
- DNS/host chosen for the DevPortal (e.g., devportal.yourdomain.com)
- Git provider account ready (GitHub or GitLab)
- Optional: Ingress controller (nginx or kong) installed in the cluster

We will detail those steps below, but if you already have them ready, you can skip to the next section named [Create or choose a target organization/group](./target-organization-group).

TODO: Add a checklist to verify if you have all the prerequisites ready.
