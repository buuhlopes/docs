## Key Features and Setup  

1. **API Discovery**
    - The **API Catalog** offers centralized access to organizational APIs, complete with search and filter tools to quickly locate specific APIs.
    - APIs are categorized and tagged for easy navigation.
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
    - Detailed documentation is provided for each API, including endpoints, parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements.
    - Additionally, code samples and tutorials may be available to support developers.
3. **Versioning and History**
    - Each API in the catalog supports multiple versions, so updates can be made without disrupting existing setups.
    - A version history helps track changes and bug fixes, enabling smooth transitions and updates.
4. **Testing and Sandbox**
    - The Catalog includes a **sandbox environment**, allowing developers to test and validate APIs before live deployment.
    - This ensures stability and reduces potential issues in production environments.
5. **Access Management and Security**
    - Access permissions can be configured for each API, controlling user roles and visibility.
    - Authorization and authentication settings ensure that only authorized personnel can access or interact with the APIs.
