## What is a Backstage distro?

A Backstage distribution (distro) is a packaged, opinionated build of Backstage that comes with curated plugins, secure defaults, integrations, and an upgrade path. Instead of stitching together the open-source core, dozens of plugins, auth, RBAC, catalog processors, and CI/CD yourself, a distro gives you a tested runtime you can deploy and operate reliably.

## Key Benefits

- **Faster time-to-value**
    
    Get a production-grade portal on day one: catalogs, software templates, documentation, search, and SSO already in place.
    
- **Secure and reliable**
    
    Built-in RBAC, vetted integrations, secure defaults, and guidance for scaling across teams.
    
- **Safe upgrades**
    
    Regular releases, non-breaking updates, and security patches ‚Äî without the pain of chasing upstream changes.
    
- **Lower total cost of ownership**
    
    Reduce engineering hours spent on building, testing, and maintaining the portal infrastructure.

## Difference from pure Backstage

**Backstage** is a powerful foundation, but using it directly means your team is responsible for:

- Building and maintaining the portal infrastructure
- Selecting, configuring, and updating dozens of plugins
- Implementing authentication, RBAC, catalog, and integrations manually
- Handling complex upgrades and the risks of local forks

The **VeeCode DevPortal** removes this overhead by offering:

- A **production-ready runtime** from day one
- **Validated and supported plugins, integrations, and standards**
- **Official support**, including guidance on upgrades, architecture, and security
- An **evolving roadmap**, ensuring your company stays current without extra effort

In short: with pure Backstage, you need to **assemble and maintain the portal**.

With the VeeCode DevPortal, you can **focus on delivering business value**.

## The DIY Challenge

Teams that try to build and maintain their own developer portal often face:

- **Constant dependency churn**: breaking changes across plugins, SDKs, and integrations.
- **Integration overhead**: ongoing glue code for auth, RBAC, catalog, and CI/CD.
- **Risky upgrades**: customizations turn into forks, making future updates painful.
- **Focus shift**: engineers spend time maintaining the portal instead of improving developer experience.

## Focus on Outcomes

Every hour spent keeping a DIY portal alive is an hour not spent on:

- Golden paths and paved-road templates
- Scorecards and governance
- Developer experience improvements

The DevPortal allows your platform team to **focus on delivering business impact**, not maintaining undifferentiated infrastructure.
