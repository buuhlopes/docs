### How to Customize Your DevPortal Theme

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to personalize your **DevPortal** using the Admin-UI, including changing the logo and modifying the appearance of the sidebar.

### Steps

### Step 1: Access Theme Settings

1. **Open Admin UI**: Access the Admin UI of your DevPortal.
2. **Navigate to Theme Settings**:
    - Click on **"Go to Settings"** in the menu.
    - Select **"Theme"** from the sidebar.

### Step 2: Customize the Platform

In the **Theme** menu, you have several options for personalizing your platform, including changing the logo and modifying the sidebar’s appearance.

1. **Changing the Sidebar Icon**:
    - Replace the default platform icon with an image of your choice. This icon will appear in shortcuts and the taskbar when the sidebar is minimized.
2. **Customizing the Full Sidebar**:
    - The sidebar is the main lateral area of the application. You can change the image or the style of this area to better fit your preferences.
3. **Advanced Customization**:
    - If you have experience with editing configuration files, you can further personalize the platform by directly adjusting the configuration file. This allows for more advanced customization options.
