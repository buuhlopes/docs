# vkdr init

You should initialize `vkdr` post-installation or after upgrading it. This command will create a hidden working folder in `~/.vkdr`, download internal tools and scripts and get you ready to go.

```bash
vkdr init
```

## What `init` will do:

- Create a hidden working folder in `~/.vkdr`
- Download `vkdr` internal tools into `~/.vkdr/bin`
- Copy `vkdr` internal scripts into `~/.vkdr/scripts`
