title: Anti-Patterns to Avoid
---

## **The "Everything Platform"**
- Trying to solve every possible use case
- Creating a monolithic platform that's difficult to maintain
- Ignoring the "thinnest viable platform" principle

## Strategy & Product Thinking Gaps

- Building custom solutions when good commercial or mature OSS options exist
- Not investing enough in integration and user experience
- Creating vendor lock-in without clear benefits
- Treating the platform as a cost center rather than a product
- Not measuring and optimizing for developer experience
- Insufficient investment in documentation and support
- Not capturing the ROI of the platform

## Over-Engineering

- Building complex solutions for simple problems
- Creating too many options that overwhelm users
- Optimizing for edge cases at the expense of common use cases

## Developer Experience Gaps

- Focusing only on functionality without considering usability
- Poor error messages and debugging experiences
- Inconsistent interfaces across different platform components
- Assuming self-service means no documentation needed
- Technical documentation that doesn't match user mental models
- Missing examples and common troubleshooting scenarios

## Cognitive Load Pitfalls

- **Tool proliferation**: Adding new tools without removing old ones
- **Inconsistent abstractions**: Different mental models for similar concepts
- **Over-configuration**: Requiring teams to make too many technical decisions
- **Over-abstraction**: Hiding so much complexity that debugging becomes impossible
- **Rigid constraints**: Preventing teams from handling legitimate edge cases
- **Magic behavior**: Platform actions that are not transparent or predictable

## Technology-First Thinking

- **Solution looking for problem**: Building features without clear user need
- **Technology bias**: Choosing tools based on team preferences rather than user needs
- **Feature creep**: Adding capabilities without considering maintenance burden

## Insufficient User Focus

- **Assumption-driven development**: Building based on what platform team thinks users need
- **Lack of user research**: Not investing in understanding actual user workflows
- **Poor feedback loops**: No systematic way to collect and act on user input
- **Ivory tower syndrome**: Platform team disconnected from day-to-day developer experience

## Operational Neglect

- **Launch and abandon**: Not investing in ongoing support and evolution
- **No SLOs**: Lack of clear commitments to platform reliability and performance
- **Reactive support**: Only addressing issues after they become critical
