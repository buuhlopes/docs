# Why You Will Build a Platform (and What That Really Means)

Building “your own platform” is inevitable for any organization growing beyond a handful of teams and services. This does not mean inventing a brand-new stack. In practice, it means bringing order, consistency, and self-service to the tooling you already have—turning fragmented scripts, pipelines, and environments into coherent golden paths.

## It’s Inevitable Because…
- **Scale and complexity**: More teams and services multiply tooling choices and operational variance when a platform standard is not in place.
- **Compliance and security**: You need consistent policy enforcement and auditability across apps and environments.
- **Developer productivity**: Teams need paved roads to reduce cognitive load and avoid re-solving the same problems.
- **Business outcomes**: Faster, safer delivery becomes a competitive necessity—not a nice-to-have.

## What “Building a Platform” Really Means
- **Standardize, don’t centralize everything**: Provide opinionated templates, defaults, and APIs—keep autonomy where it matters.
- **Codify the best path**: Golden paths for common workflows (create service, build, test, deploy, observe, operate).
- **Turn tickets into self-service**: Replace manual handoffs with portal/CLI/API actions.
- **Make existing tools coherent**: Integrate your current CI/CD, IaC, runtime, and observability—minimize net-new tools.

:::tip Organizing the existing tooling chaos
Most “platform work” is curating and integrating the tools you already run, not buying or building more. Start by standardizing how teams use them.

## Motivations and Benefits
- **Consistency and reliability**: Fewer snowflakes; safer changes by default.
- **Faster flow of change**: Shorter lead time, higher deployment frequency.
- **Lower cognitive load**: Teams focus on business logic instead of infrastructure quirks.
- **Security and compliance by design**: Policy baked into pipelines and runtime.
- **Cost efficiency**: Shared templates and guardrails reduce waste and duplication.

## What Not to Do
- **Don’t build a monolith**: Aim for the thinnest viable platform that solves the most common problems first.
- **Don’t chase tools**: Favor standardization over adding new vendors or bespoke components.
- **Don’t remove autonomy**: Provide defaults and APIs; let teams extend when justified.
- **Don’t hide in a cave**: Solve real problems that teams face on a regular basis.

## How to Start
1. **Map the journeys**: Document the top workflows (create service, deploy, rollback, debug).
2. **Get sponsorship**: This will require a dedicated team and cross-functional collaboration fro others to align priorities and resources, not to mention a clear understanding that management goals must adapt.
2. **Pick the first golden path**: Standardize the highest-volume, highest-friction journey. Look for an obvious and measurable ROI to build consensus on.
3. **Codify as templates + APIs**: CI/CD, IaC, runtime baselines, and policy-as-code. There is always something that people have long struggled to achieve.
4. **Ship self-service**: Portal/CLI to replace the most common tickets.
5. **Measure impact**: Track DORA and adoption metrics from day one. Remember: platform value appears in downstream metrics, not as a plain platform output. **Learn to capture the ROI of your platform to make ROI visible**.

## How to Prove It Works
- Use outcome metrics that matter to the business. See: [Success Metrics](../capabilities/success-metrics).
- Anchor platform scope in team cognition and interactions. See: [Team Topologies](../references/team-topologies).
- Ground your architecture and operating model in modern practices. See: [Cloud Native Transformation](../references/cloud-native-transformation).
